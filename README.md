<h1 align="center">vaultview.nvim</h1>

A Neovim plugin to visualize your notes vault in a board-style view — for quick, contextual overviews without relying on a file tree (that is limited for this sort of overview).

---


VaultView allows users to create customizable boards that give a quick, visual overview of their note vault.
Instead of navigating through a file tree, VaultView parses and displays your notes in boards or matrices — giving you an at-a-glance view of what’s inside and what each note contains.

With it, you can:
- Quickly browse your vault in a structured, board-like interface.
- See summaries or key content (like headings, links, or metadata) from your notes.
- Open notes directly in Neovim or Obsidian.
- Navigate the boards fluidly using Vim motions or custom pickers.

## ⚙️ How it works

The plugin is architectured around the concept of MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

A board in VaultView consists of three main parts:

1. Board Data (The Model)

The data is generated by a parser, which:
- Takes all (or a subset) of your vault’s files => "Input Selection"
- Organizes it into a structured format => "Board Data Structuring"
- Extracts and aggregates relevant information for each entry => "Content Selection"
```
Board
 ├── Pages
 │    ├── Lists (one column/block per list)
 │    │    ├── Entries (one card per entry)
 │    │    │    └── Content (displayed in cards)
```

__Currently Supported Parsers:__
- Daily Note Parser -> Retrieves all daily notes in your vault, sorts them by year/month, and extracts headings for each day.
- MOC Parser -> Finds all your MOC files and, for each one, lists all files linking to it — along with their headings (to display a TOC inside each card).

2. View (The Controller)
The View holds data and states related to one board.
It delegates the rendering of the data to a specific layout.

3. View Layout (The View)

The layout determines how the parsed data is displayed.

__Currently Supported Layouts:__
- Vertical Carousel
- Columns

## 💡 Why this plugin

I love Obsidian — especially for features like the Excalidraw plugin and great table handling.
However, when it comes to navigation with hjkl and text editing, nothing beats Neovim.

What I missed most in Obsidian was a quick way to visualize my vault based on certain criteria — for example:
- Seeing what’s inside all my MOCs (Maps of Content)
- Browsing through all my Daily Notes

Obsidian has Dataview and Bases, but:
- They’re confined within Obsidian’s UI.
- They require a specific query/config language.
- They lack the power of Vim motions.

I actually started thinking about VaultView before Obsidian Bases even existed — and it turned out to be a great way to learn Lua and Neovim plugin development.

            initial_board_idx = 1, -- index of the board to be displayed when opening the vaultview. Optional.
		}
	end,
}
```

### Input and Content selectors
The plugin comes with some default input and content selectors that can be used in the board configuration.
In the configuration one can specify custom ones for input selector as either : a list of files, a shell command returning a list of files, or a Lua function returning a list of files.
content_selectors only accepts shell commands returning content lines for each entry.
The current default ones are:

```lua
local input_selectors = {
    ["*"] = [[find %q -type f | sort ]],
    ["*.md"] = [[find %q -type f -name '*.md' | sort ]],
    ["yyyy-mm-dd.md"] = [[find %q -type f | sort | grep -E '/[0-9]{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\.md$']],
}

local content_selectors = {
    headings = [=[grep -E '^#+[[:space:]]+.+' %q | sed -E 's/^#+[[:space:]]+//' ]=],
    h1 = [=[grep -E '^#[[:space:]]+.+' %q | sed -E 's/^#[[:space:]]+//' ]=],
    h2 = [=[grep -E '^##[[:space:]]+.+' %q | sed -E 's/^##[[:space:]]+//' ]=],
    h3 = [=[grep -E '^###[[:space:]]+.+' %q | sed -E 's/^###[[:space:]]+//' ]=],
    h4 = [=[grep -E '^####[[:space:]]+.+' %q | sed -E 's/^####[[:space:]]+//' ]=],
    h2_awk_noexcalidraw = [=[awk '/^# Excalidraw Data/ { exit } /^##[[:space:]]+.+/ { sub(/^##[[:space:]]+/, ""); print }' %q]=],
    h2_rg_noexcalidraw = [=[rg --until-pattern '^# Excalidraw Data' '^##[[:space:]]+.+$' %q | sed -E 's/^##[[:space:]]+//' ]=],
}
```

### Custom parsers
One can provide in the configuration their own custom parsers by providing a function to the "parser" field of a board configuration.
The function should take as input the vault subtable of the configuration and the board configuration table:

```lua

--- parse a vault folder to create a board data structure depending on the board configuration
---@param vault configuration of the vault {path: string, name: string}
---@param custom_selectors configuration of user custom selectors {input_selectors: table, entry_content_selectors: table}
---@param boardConfig configuration of the board {name:string, parser: string|function, viewlayout: string, subfolder: string, pattern: string}
---@return The BoardDataStructure as expected by a ViewLayout
parser = function(vault_config, custom_selectors, board_config)
    end
```

Warning: As this plugin is still in early development, the API for custom parsers may change in future releases + pattern matching is currently very basic (see TODOs).

## Usage
Once setup and your neovim instance running, you can use the following commands to interact with VaultView.
<!-- plugin/vaultview.lua for details. -->

```vim
:Vaultview open
:Vaultview close
:Vaultview refresh
```

or you can map your preferred keybinding to `<Plug>(Vaultview)` to open the main VaultView window.

## Keybinds inside VaultView UI
See [default keybinds](lua/vaultview/keymaps.lua) for details. May change in the future.

It's planned to allow user configuration of keybinds in future releases.
