<h1 align="center">vaultview.nvim</h1>

A Neovim plugin to visualize your notes vault in a board-style view — for quick, contextual overviews without relying on a file tree (that is limited for this sort of overview).

---


VaultView allows users to create customizable boards that give a quick, visual overview of their note vault.
Instead of navigating through a file tree, VaultView parses and displays your notes in boards or matrices — giving you an at-a-glance view of what’s inside and what each note contains.

With it, you can:
- Quickly browse your vault in a structured, board-like interface.
- See summaries or key content (like headings, links, or metadata) from your notes.
- Open notes directly in Neovim or Obsidian.
- Navigate the boards fluidly using Vim motions or custom pickers.

## ⭐ Features
- Search / Parse / Display specific files in a matrix or board view
- Open the corresponding file in Neovim or Obsidian
- Navigate between board entries using Vim motions or custom pickers
- Fully customizable boards — define what subset of your vault each one displays
- Access the files of your vault for quick edit from any Neovim project

## ⚙️ How it works

A board in VaultView consists of two main parts:

1. Board Data

The data is generated by a parser, which:
- Takes all (or a subset) of your vault’s files
- Extracts and aggregates relevant information
- Organizes it into a structured format:
```
Board
 ├── Pages
 │    ├── Lists (one column/block per list)
 │    │    ├── Entries (one card per entry)
 │    │    │    └── Content (displayed in cards)
```

__Currently Supported Parsers:__
- Daily Note Parser -> Retrieves all daily notes in your vault, sorts them by year/month, and extracts headings for each day.
- MOC Parser -> Finds all your MOC files and, for each one, lists all files linking to it — along with their headings (to display a TOC inside each card).

2. View Layout

The layout determines how the parsed data is displayed.

__Currently Supported Layouts:__
- Vertical Carousel
- Columns

## 💡 Why this plugin

I love Obsidian — especially for features like the Excalidraw plugin and great table handling.
However, when it comes to navigation with hjkl and text editing, nothing beats Neovim.

What I missed most in Obsidian was a quick way to visualize my vault based on certain criteria — for example:
- Seeing what’s inside all my MOCs (Maps of Content)
- Browsing through all my Daily Notes

Obsidian has Dataview and Bases, but:
- They’re confined within Obsidian’s UI.
- They require a specific query/config language.
- They lack the power of Vim motions.

I actually started thinking about VaultView before Obsidian Bases even existed — and it turned out to be a great way to learn Lua and Neovim plugin development.

## External dependencies
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)


## Installation


- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    "fvalenza/vaultview",
    dependencies = { "ColinKennedy/mega.cmdparse", "ColinKennedy/mega.logging", "folke/snacks.nvim" },
}
```

## Configuration


- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
return {
	"fvalenza/vaultview",
	dependencies = { "ColinKennedy/mega.cmdparse", "ColinKennedy/mega.logging", "folke/snacks.nvim" },

	keys = {
		{ "<leader>vv", "<Plug>(Vaultview)", mode = "n", desc = "Open VaultView" },
	},

	config = function()
		vim.g.vaultview_configuration = {
			vault = {
				path = "/path/to/your/vault", -- full path to your vault
				name = "myVault",
			},
			boards = {
				{
					name = "dailyBoard", -- name of the board as printed in the top of UI
					parser = "daily", -- parser used to retrieve information to display in the view -> currently supported parsers: "daily", "moc"
					viewlayout = "carousel", -- how information is displayed in the view -> currently supported layouts: "carousel", "columns"
                    subfolder = "vault/0-dailynotes", -- optional subfolder inside vault to limit the scope of the parser
                    pattern = "yyyy-mm-dd", -- only the filename, without extension -- TODO: support regex
					-- show_empty_months = false, -- TODO: not implemented yet
				},
				{
					name = "mocBoard",
					parser = "moc",
					viewlayout = "columns",
                    subfolder = "vault/1-MOCs",
                    pattern = "*", -- only the filename, without extension -- TODO: support regex
					file_title = "strip-moc", -- TODO: could be "date" or "basename" or "strip-moc". Currently the moc parser always strips because for MY needs it's prettier
				},
			},
		}
	end,
}
```

### Custom parsers
One can provide in the configuration their own custom parsers by providing a function to the "parser" field of a board configuration.
The function should take as input the vault subtable of the configuration and the board configuration table:

```lua

--- parse a vault folder to create a board data structure depending on the board configuration
---@param vault configuration of the vault {path: string, name: string}
---@param boardConfig configuration of the board {name:string, parser: string|function, viewlayout: string, subfolder: string, pattern: string}
---@return The BoardDataStructure as expected by a ViewLayout
parser = function(vault_config, board_config)
    end
```

Warning: As this plugin is still in early development, the API for custom parsers may change in future releases + pattern matching is currently very basic (see TODOs).

## Usage
Once setup and your neovim instance running, you can use the following commands to interact with VaultView.
<!-- plugin/vaultview.lua for details. -->

```vim
:Vaultview open
:Vaultview close
:Vaultview refresh
```

or you can map your preferred keybinding to `<Plug>(Vaultview)` to open the main VaultView window.


## Roadmap
Incoming


## Known Issues
- [ ] When opening a file associated to an entry with <CR>, and when quitting it to return to main window of the vaultview ("q"), it comes back to the first board instead of the previsouly active one
- [ ] Action to "center cursor/focus" on viewlayoutcarousel to fix
