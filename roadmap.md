Just a bunch of ideas/todo. No priority set yet.

- Integration with [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim)
- Allow overwriting of keybinds in plugin configuration
- Parsers to add : at least ones i can think of are task parsers(content_selector to be tested), Eisenhower matrix, -> feel free to try to create one by cloning and modifying the plugin
- Test/Debug the ability to provide custom parsers from user's configuration
- ViewLayout to add : grid, rows
- ViewLayout that do not display entries/content (to have a tablet-like UI with only big labels to some files)
- Search functionality
